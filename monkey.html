                <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                <p>There are currently 264 known monkey species.

Monkeys can be divided into two groups, Old World monkeys that live in Africa and Asia, and New World monkeys that live in South America.
A baboon is an example of an Old World monkey, while a marmoset is an example of a New World monkey.
Apes are not monkeys.
Some monkeys live on the ground, while others live in trees.
Different monkey species eat a variety of foods, such as fruit, insects, flowers, leaves and reptiles.
Most monkeys have tails.
Groups of monkeys are known as a ‘tribe’, ‘troop’ or ‘mission’.
The Pygmy Marmoset is the smallest type of monkey, with adults weighing between 120 and 140 grams.
The Mandrill is the largest type of monkey, with adult males weighing up to 35 kg.
Capuchin monkeys are believed to be one of the smartest New World monkey species. They have the ability to use tools, learn new skills and show various signs of self-awareness.
Spider monkeys get their name because of their long arms, legs and tail.
